## Part B: Written Submission (100-300 words)

### 12.5 Write Submission Text

```markdown
# Content Repurposing Engine

Transforms video transcripts into platform-ready social content using
AI-powered extraction and a premium quality gate.

## What It Does

1. **Input**: Paste a video transcript via web form
2. **Extract**: AI identifies key ideas, quotes, and frameworks
3. **Generate**: Creates 9 content pieces:
   - 5 Twitter posts
   - 3 LinkedIn posts
   - 1 Newsletter section
4. **Quality Gate**: Second-pass AI critique scores each piece
5. **Output**: Stored in Google Sheets for review and scheduling

## What Makes It Different

- **Voice DNA Calibration**: Content matches the creator's authentic voice
- **Quality Gate**: Every post is scored on hook, specificity, value, and CTA
- **Zero Ongoing Costs**: Runs on Gemini free tier + Google Sheets

## Tech Stack

- **Hosting**: Hostinger VPS (self-hosted)
- **Orchestration**: n8n (Docker)
- **AI**: Google Gemini Flash (free tier)
- **Storage**: Google Sheets

## Why It Matters

Creators spend hours repurposing long-form content. This engine does
it in under 2 minutes while maintaining quality that sounds human,
not like "AI slop."

Built for the creator who values quality over quantity.
