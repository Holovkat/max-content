### Max Content - AI-Powered Content Repurposing Engine

Transform long-form content into platform-ready social posts with one click.

**What It Does:**

1. **Input**: Submit content via web form (YouTube URL, transcript, or raw text)
2. **Generate**: AI creates platform-specific content using Google Gemini
3. **Preview**: Review all generated content before posting
4. **Publish**: One-click approval posts to X, LinkedIn, and sends newsletters

**Platforms Supported:**

- **X/Twitter**: Punchy tweets with hooks (auto-post)
- **LinkedIn**: Professional posts with white space (auto-post)
- **Newsletter**: Email with key takeaways (sent via Resend)
- **Instagram**: Engaging captions (copy-ready)
- **Skool**: Community discussion posts (copy-ready)

**What Makes It Different:**

- **Single input, multiple outputs**: One form generates all platforms
- **Visual preview**: See exactly what will post before approving
- **Actual posting**: Not just generation - it posts and sends
- **Quality content**: Hook → Value → CTA structure, no AI slop

**Tech Stack:**

- **Orchestration**: n8n (self-hosted on Hostinger VPS)
- **AI**: Google Gemini Flash
- **Posting**: Twitter API, LinkedIn API, Resend
- **Cost**: Zero ongoing fees (free tier APIs)

**Result:**

What used to take hours of manual repurposing now happens in under 2 minutes.
One click. Five platforms. Done.
