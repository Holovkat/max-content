# PRD: Content Repurposing Engine  
**Hostinger x n8n Hackathon – Content Management Build**

## Submission Process – Instructional Checklist

Use this as your **personal checklist** to close out and deliver the project.

### 8.1 Pre-Submission: Technical Verification

- [ ] **Hostinger VPS Setup**
  - [ ] Hostinger VPS (KVM2 or equivalent) is active.
  - [ ] n8n is installed and accessible via HTTPS.
  - [ ] You can log into n8n editor successfully.

- [ ] **Workflow Functionality**
  - [ ] `Transcript_Ingestion` workflow runs without errors.
  - [ ] `Content_Generation` workflow runs without errors.
  - [ ] At least one realistic transcript has been processed E2E.
  - [ ] Outputs are stored in Airtable/Notion/Sheet/DB with clear fields.

- [ ] **Content Quality Check**
  - [ ] Each generated post has a **clear hook**.
  - [ ] Each post delivers **concrete value** (not vague advice).
  - [ ] Each post ends with a **natural CTA** tailored to platform.
  - [ ] Posts are not repetitive or obviously AI-generic.
  - [ ] You can confidently say: “I would post this as-is (or with light edits).”

### 8.2 Demo Video (1–2 Minutes)

- [ ] **Plan a Simple Script:**
  - [ ] **Intro (10–15s):**  
        Who you are + what the build does ("Content Repurposing Engine that turns long-form video into multi-platform content").
  - [ ] **Architecture Overview (20–30s):**  
        Briefly show diagram or explain: transcript in → n8n → LLM → storage.
  - [ ] **Live Run (40–60s):**
        - [ ] Show starting a workflow with a sample transcript.
        - [ ] Show n8n running (nodes executing).
        - [ ] Show final outputs in storage (e.g., Airtable/Sheet) for multiple platforms.
  - [ ] **Wrap-Up (10–15s):**  
        Emphasize benefits: saves time, maintains quality, flexible across niches.

- [ ] **Recording**
  - [ ] Use screen recorder (no need for face cam unless you want).
  - [ ] Ensure URL bar or sensitive keys are not exposed.
  - [ ] Show something that clearly indicates **Hostinger** (e.g., VPS overview or URL/hostname screenshot).

- [ ] **Final Check**
  - [ ] Video length between 1–2 minutes.
  - [ ] Audio clear (or captions if silent).
  - [ ] Save file in a shareable format (mp4, etc).

### 8.3 Written Submission (100–300 Words)

- [ ] Include:
  - [ ] **One-sentence overview** of the solution.
  - [ ] **Short description** of input → processing → output.
  - [ ] **Why it’s useful** for creators / real-world application.
  - [ ] **Note that it’s self-hosted on Hostinger + n8n**.
- [ ] Keep it:
  - [ ] Clear.
  - [ ] Non-technical or lightly technical (judges should understand quickly).
  - [ ] Within 100–300 words.

*(You can draft a version, then refine it once the build is fully working.)*

### 8.4 Hostinger Proof & Eligibility

- [ ] Confirm:
  - [ ] Workflow is running on **Hostinger VPS**, not local or n8n cloud.
  - [ ] You have at least one screenshot or in-demo proof of Hostinger usage.
- [ ] If using a custom domain:
  - [ ] Consider showing **Hostinger hPanel → VPS overview** instead of the raw subdomain.

### 8.6 Optional Extras (Nice-to-Have)
